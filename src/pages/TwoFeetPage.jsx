        "In Two Feet’s new album Pink, American singer/songwriter Zachary
        William Dess takes his well-known blend of electronica and soul to new
        heights, reaching a sound that comes across almost like a movie score.
        The focus is largely on Dess’ skills as a producer, with the beats
        driving the mood for the most part."
